# OrnithologyPi: Bird Detection and Streaming on Raspberry Pi

OrnithologyPi is a Rust-based project that captures and analyzes a video stream to detect and identify birds. It runs on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a webcam, providing a seamless interface for observing and identifying birds in your garden or any outdoor setting.

## üé• How It Works

1. **Capture Stream**: Utilizes a webcam to capture a live video stream.
2. **Analyze Stream**: Analyzes the stream to detect the presence of birds.
3. **Identify Birds**: Identifies the detected birds and labels them.
4. **Web App Interface**: Offers a web app for viewing the live stream and observed birds.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Ensure the installation of gstreamer development libraries for proper camera support:

```sh
apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev v4l-utils
```

### Examples

- **Webcam Example**: Save output at `frame.jpg`.

  ```sh
  cargo run --example webcam
  ```

- **Crop Example**: Save the cropped bird image at `crop.jpg`.

  ```sh
  cargo run --example crop
  ```

- **Label Example**: Print the detected bird on the image.

  ```sh
  cargo run --example label
  ```

- **Window Example**: Navigate through frames and exit as needed.

  ```sh
  cargo run --features="window" example window
  ```

## üì¶ Building and Installation

### Build Debian Package

```sh
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
```

### Build App

![App](docs/app_screenshot.png)

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ornithology-app
```

### Build for Raspberry Pi

Utilize crossbuild for building for Raspberry Pi:

```sh
cargo install cross
cargo install cargo-deb
docker build -t crossbuild:local -f crossbuild.Dockerfile .
cross build --release --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
cargo deb --no-build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

### Install on Raspberry Pi

Install the necessary plugins and the application:

```sh
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
wget https://github.com/chriamue/ornithology-pi/releases/latest/download/ornithology-pi.deb
sudo apt install ./ornithology-pi.deb
```

To start the service:

```sh
sudo service ornithology-pi start
```

To enable the service on boot:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable ornithology-pi
```

## üêû Debugging

### Bluetooth Debugging

For a Bluetooth services overview, visit `chrome://bluetooth-internals/#devices` in the Chrome browser.

### Known Issues

- **Bluetooth Issue**: Run the app with `BLUETOOTH_FORCE_DBUS_LE_VERSION=1` to resolve Bluetooth issues.
